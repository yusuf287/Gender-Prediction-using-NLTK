# Gender-Prediction-using-NLTK

This package is a Python 3 port of Stephen Holiday's genderPredictor nltk.NaiveBayesClassifier wrapper. 
It has been rewritten mostly for personal use and is now used in a variety of unreleased classification projects of mine. 
More details to come on how I have used it...
